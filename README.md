### Abstract: 
Sporulation is a strategy employed by many bacteria to survive harsh environmental conditions. The genus *Paenibacillus* includes spore-forming species notorious for spoiling pasteurized dairy products and for causing American foulbrood disease in honeybee larvae, leading to colony collapse. Human pathogens within *Paenibacillus* are also a growing threat, causing fatal opportunistic infections. Here, we present a comprehensive survey of sporulation genes across 1460 high-quality *Paenibacillus* genomes. We find that all members of the sporulation-initiating phosphorelay are well-conserved, but that the Spo0B phosphotransferase contains a predicted transmembrane domain. We confirm that this domain localizes Spo0B to the cell membrane and therefore refer to this Spo0B variant as Spo0B-TM. Spo0B-TM is present in 92% of surveyed *Paenibacillus* genomes. Consistent with its high level of conservation, we find that the transmembrane domain is important for detecting its interaction with its phosphorelay partners Spo0A and Spo0F. Moreover, we find that Spo0B exhibits low sequence identity across Bacilli when compared to other members of the phosphorelay. Altogether, this work highlights the potential for diversity even within the highly conserved phosphorelay that initiates sporulation in Bacillota.
